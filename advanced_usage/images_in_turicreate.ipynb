    "# **Getting Images into the TuriCreate framework**\n",
    "In the example we provided in `image_similarity.ipynb`, we used Caltech's 101 Object Categories image data set, provided as a `.tar.gz` file. However, your image data may be in a different format or file structure. This notebook is intended as an example for how to take a dataset in a different format and get it into the Turi Create framework. \n",

    "Turi Create likes to load images from a directory where you pass the directory to the function `tc.load_images('directory_name')`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are using the popular CIFAR-10 dataset which can be downloaded [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). You will need to use the CIFAR-10 Python version. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importing this data into the Turi Create framework requires the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Batch load all of the CIFAR-10 images from the link above into a dictionary\n",
    "2. Save this object into a local folder. This is because loading in-memory images into Turi Create is currently difficult, but loading from a file is easy. For more context, see:  https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/119\n",
    "3. Load the images from this folder into Turi Create using `tc.load_images('directory_name')`\n",
    "4. Identify the labels for each image based on the file path. \n",
